# HBusbyGreaterThanOrLessThan

Create a program that takes 2 user-inputted numbers and then tells the user if the numbers are greater than, less than, or equal to each other.
Program uses while loop to play again, TryParse to make the string into an integer, and data validation so the user doesnt input a word instead of numbers.
