# HBusbyGreaterThanOrLessThan

Create a program that takes 2 user-inputted numbers and then tells the user if the numbers are greater than, less than, or equal to each other.
Program uses while loop to play again, TryParse to make the string into an integer, and data validation so the user doesnt input a word instead of numbers. 

# Peer Review by Griffin Parker

This program meets all the requirements for the assignment and functions well. There are a few things I would change/add however. A Console.Clear() at the top of the program would help keep the terminal less cluttered when restarting the program and running it again. The option to restart at the end would also benefit from only ending when someone types 'no' and looping until the response given by the user is either yes or no. I also think it would be a good change to add a loop to  make the user input a number if one of the inputs they give is not valid instead of making them restart the program after an invalid entry.
